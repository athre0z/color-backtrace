# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v0.3.0] (2019-11-12)

#### Added
- Custom `ColorScheme` support
- Forward backtrace-rs' `gimli-symbolize` feature, which is default enabled
  - This is done by adding `default-features = false` to the `Cargo.toml`
    dependency entry for `color-backtrace`
  - Disabling it reduces transitive dependencies from ~50 â†’ ~10
  - However, you'll pay for it with [inaccurate source info](https://github.com/athre0z/color-backtrace/issues/2) on macOS
    and Linux

#### Changed
- Replace `term` crate for colorful term printing with `termcolor`
  - This crate is more actively maintained, has fewer deps and a better API
  - This made adding color scheme support very easy
- `Settings::dim_function_hash_part` was replaced
  - Hash part color is now controlled via `ColorScheme`

#### Removed
- `Colorize`, `ColorizedStderrOutput`, `StreamOutput`, `PanicOutputStream`
  - This functionality is now all provided by the `termcolor` crate
  - `termcolor` is re-exported in the root of `color_backtrace`
- Lots of transitive dependencies!
