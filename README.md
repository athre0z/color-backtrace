A Rust library that makes panics a little less painful by nicely colorizing them
and printing the relevant source snippets.

```toml
[dependencies]
color-backtrace = { version = "0.6" }
```

To enable it, simply place this code somewhere in your app initialization code:
```rust
color_backtrace::install();
```

If you want to customize some settings, you can instead do:
```rust
use color_backtrace::{default_output_stream, BacktracePrinter};
BacktracePrinter::new().message("Custom message!").install(default_output_stream());
```

### Features
- Colorize backtraces to be easier on the eyes
- Show source snippets if source files are found on disk
- Print frames of application code vs dependencies in different color
- Hide all the frames after the panic was already initiated
- Hide language runtime initialization frames

### Usage in tests

Unfortunately, defining custom init functions run before tests are started is
currently [not supported in Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1664).
Since initializing color-backtrace in each and every test is tedious even when
wrapping it into a function, I recommended using the
[ctor](https://crates.io/crates/ctor) crate for this.

Somewhere, preferably in your crate's main module, put the following code:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use ctor::ctor;

    #[ctor]
    fn init_color_backtrace() {
        color_backtrace::install();
    }
}
```

You can also do this outside of a `#[cfg(test)]` section, in which case the
panic handler is installed for both test and regular runs.
