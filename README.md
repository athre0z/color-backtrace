A Rust library that makes panics a little less painful by nicely colorizing them
and printing the relevant source snippets.

```toml
[dependencies]
color-backtrace = { version = "0.1" }
```

To enable it, simply place this code somewhere in your app initialization code:
```rust
color_backtrace::install();
```

If you want to customize some settings, you can instead do:
```rust
use color_backtrace::{install_with_settings, Settings};
install_with_settings(Settings::new().message("Custom message!"));
```

### Features
- Colorize backtraces to be easier on the eyes
- Show source snippets if source files are found on disk
- Print frames of application code vs dependencies in different color
- Hide all the frames after the panic was already initiated
