A Rust library that makes panics a little less painful by nicely colorizing them
and printing the relevant source snippets.

```toml
[dependencies]
color-backtrace = { version = "0.3" }
```

To enable it, simply place this code somewhere in your app initialization code:
```rust
color_backtrace::install();
```

If you want to customize some settings, you can instead do:
```rust
use color_backtrace::{default_output_stream, BacktracePrinter};
BacktracePrinter::new().message("Custom message!").install(default_output_stream());
```

### Features
- Colorize backtraces to be easier on the eyes
- Show source snippets if source files are found on disk
- Print frames of application code vs dependencies in different color
- Hide all the frames after the panic was already initiated
- Hide language runtime initialization frames

### Optional Features

- **`failure-bt`** — Experimental support for printing `failure::Backtrace` backtraces.

### **Experimental** Failure backtrace integration

`failure` backtraces are opaque and so this feature uses unsafe code to
transmute the struct into a non private struct to allow access to the internal
`backtrace::Backtrace` object.

The code is dependent on and only tested against failure version `0.1.5` and is
considered a temporary hack while we work on getting backtraces from errors
exposed properly. This feature is marked as unsafe, it relies on UB to work,
and there is no guarantee that rust will pick this layout on a different crate
type. User discretion is advised.

To enable, include the following in your Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
color-backtrace = { version = "0.3", features = ["failure-bt"] }
```

### Reducing transitive dependencies

In order to reduce transitive dependencies, you can disable the default
enabled `gimli-symbolize` feature by adding a `default-features = false`
clause to your `Cargo.toml` dependency entry, e.g.:

```toml
[dependencies]
color-backtrace = { version = "0.3", default-features = false }
```

This will reduce dependencies from ~50 → ~10. However, you'll pay for it with
[inaccurate source info](https://github.com/athre0z/color-backtrace/issues/2)
on macOS and Linux

### Usage in tests

Unfortunately, defining custom init functions run before tests are started is
currently [not supported in Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1664).
Since initializing color-backtrace in each and every test is tedious even when
wrapping it into a function, I recommended using the
[ctor](https://crates.io/crates/ctor) crate for this.

Somewhere, preferably in your crate's main module, put the following code:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use ctor::ctor;

    #[ctor]
    fn init_color_backtrace() {
        color_backtrace::install();
    }
}
```

You can also do this outside of a `#[cfg(test)]` section, in which case the
panic handler is installed for both test and regular runs.
